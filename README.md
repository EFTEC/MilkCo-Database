It is a database model of a Milk Company that we could use to test and evaluate Business Intelligence and Data Science.

## Features

* Products (Skus) divided in types, subtypes, container (cup, bottle, etc.) and brands.
* 3 Brands: Value Pack, Auntie Annie and Red Label (cheap, normal and expensive)
* More than 10 years of sales.

* 64000 Invoice details. The invoices have stationary trends.
* 3563 Customers. Some of them are companies
* The database model is vanilla and clean. It does not have views, store procedure, functions or even index (with the exception of primary key and foreign keys)
* The columns are normalized to use the minimum type of definitions.

| types              | Mysql Definition |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Integer numbers    | int              |
| Strings and texts  | varchar          |
| Money and decimals | decimal(10,2)    |
| Booleans           | tinyint          |
| Date               | DateTime         |
| Timestamps         | Timestamp        |

## Specifications

* Every Indexes have a prefix called "id" with the exception of "Sku", where "sku" is the index without a prefix.
* Foreign keys don't have a special name. Usually they have the same name than the primary key.
* All tables are in plural. Composed names are written in camel case.
* Columns are written in lowercase and it starts in lowercase.

## Considerations

* It works with MySQL 8.0 or higher**.   It could work with an older version of MySQL but you must replace the encoding:

```sql
![invoices_per_day](D:\dropbox\Projects\MilkCo-Database\invoices_per_day.jpg)-- mysql 8.0
DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
-- mysql <=5.7
DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 
```

* It misses some features. For example, a table of purchases, the salaries and the costs of each branches are fixed
* Values are not inflationary. 
* It lacks shipping
* It does not consider taxes. If the taxes are flat, then it is not a problem.

## Trends

This database was created with random values. However, it has some trends (that I don't want to spoil much the results ðŸ˜€)

### For example, the invoices per day (January 2020)

![](D:\dropbox\Projects\MilkCo-Database\invoices_per_day.jpg)

So, apparently, there is not a trend.

### And Invoices per day week (January 2020)

![](D:\dropbox\Projects\MilkCo-Database\invoices-per-day-week.jpg)

Did you see the trend?

2. Run the [ddl.sql](ddql.sql)  script
   1. It includes the structure of the database and the foreign key.s
3. Run the [dml.sql](dml.sql) script.
   1. It includes the data of the database.
